Here are the instructions to play the text-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python:

Run the Python program on your computer.
The game board is represented as a list of 9 spaces, with each space being either an "X", "O", or a space character " ".
The game starts with player X, who makes the first move by entering a number between 1 and 9, indicating the space they want to occupy.
The game then alternates between player X and player O, with each player making a move by entering a number between 1 and 9.
The game ends when either player X or player O has three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all spaces on the board are filled and there is no winner.
If player X wins, the program will print "X wins! Congratulations!" and the game will end. If player O wins, the program will print "O wins! Congratulations!" and the game will end. If the game ends in a draw, the program will print "It's a draw!".
To play the game again, run the program again.
