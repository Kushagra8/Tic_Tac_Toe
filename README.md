Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game

Introduction

Welcome to the Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game in Python! This project demonstrates basic modular coding, creativity in design, and effective software writing practices. Below, you will find instructions on how to play this game.

Game Overview

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic board game that offers both entertainment and an opportunity to showcase a robust coding solution. In this project, we've implemented the game using Python. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, with each space represented as either "X," "O," or an empty space. Two players, "X" and "O," take turns to place their symbols on the board.

Key Features

Coding Standards: This project adheres to professional coding standards, including meaningful variable names, clear documentation, and well-structured code.
Research and Design: Extensive research and thoughtful design went into creating this game. It considers user experience, gameplay logic, and efficient coding practices.
Creativity in User Interface: While the game is text-based, creativity was applied in designing a clear and intuitive interface for players to enjoy a smooth gaming experience.
Winning Logic: The game incorporates winning logic to determine the winner when a player aligns three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw Scenario: In the event that all spaces are filled without a winner, the game elegantly identifies a draw scenario and concludes the game accordingly.

How to Play

Run the Python program on your computer using a Python environment.
The game board will be displayed, representing the 3x3 grid.
Player "X" starts the game and makes the first move by entering a number between 1 and 9, indicating the space they wish to occupy.
Players take turns alternating between "X" and "O," each selecting a number between 1 and 9 to make their move.
The game ends when a player aligns three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all spaces on the board are filled.
Winning and Draw Outcomes

If "X" wins, the program will announce "Player X wins! Congratulations!" and conclude the game.
If "O" wins, the program will declare "Player O wins! Congratulations!" and end the game.
In case of a draw, the program will state "It's a draw!" and conclude the game.
Enjoy and Replay

Feel free to enjoy the game and replay it as many times as you like. Running the program again will initiate a new game session, providing endless entertainment and a chance to test your strategic skills.
